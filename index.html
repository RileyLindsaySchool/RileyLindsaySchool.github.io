		<h1>Hello, GitHub!</h1>

		<p>If this text is displayed, then it should mean that the style is already working. If you can see this but the background is still white, then you have included the stylesheet incorrectly.</p>
		<p>There was a typo in the styles.css file. However, this should be fixed now. In other words, if you can see this text, then you should see the background color as well.</p>
		<p style="color: tomato;">The typo was fixed yet the background color is still white. To debug this, I have copied verbatim a stylesheet from the external stylesheet example in W3Schools.</p>
